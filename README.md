## Getting Started

1. Read the [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs) to understand about Remix.
2. If you're new, focus on Remix basics, don't use the Stacks yet. Read
   [Super Simple Start to Remix](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix).
3. If you're experienced, can already use various integration such as Prisma ORM
   and database like MySQL. Read
   [Blog Tutorial (short)](http://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/blog) and
   [App Tutorial (long)](http://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/jokes).

## Tech Stack

1. [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org): Typed language
   - Related to JavaScript, HTML, CSS
2. [React](https://react.dev): UI library
3. [Remix](https://remix.run): Web framework
   - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com)
4. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Styling
5. [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com): Interactive components
   - [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com): Styled interactive components
6. [Prisma](https://prisma.io): Database ORM
7. [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com): MySQL-compatible serverless database
   platform
   - [MySQL](https://mysql.com): Database management system
8. [Vercel](https://vercel.com): App deployment

## Setup

Create the `.env` file from the example `.env` file.

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env
```

> This .env file is only for local development, not production

Let's configure the required environment variables in the `.env` file if local,
otherwise in the project settings, for:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SESSION_SECRET`

Create a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) account to have a MySQL instance
for development. After the database has been created, "Get the connection
string" and select "Prisma", then copy the full `DATABASE_URL`.

> Keep in mind the free plan only allow for 1 database. So either later you keep
> it, delete it when unused, or upgrade your plan.

Generate a random string for the `SESSION_SECRET` using
`openssl rand -base64 32` on the terminal or you can put any long random text.

```sh
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/bearmentor?sslaccept=strict"
SESSION_SECRET="random_secret_text"
```

## Development

### Dependencies

To run the app locally, make sure the project's local dependencies are
installed:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Code

Format, lint, and build to check your setup is fine:

```sh
pnpm check
# run: format lint stylelint build

pnpm check:fix # to fix most cases if there's an issue
# run: format:fix lint:fix stylelint:fix
```

> Note: Ignore non-critical warning about ESLint and TypeScript

### Database

Sync between the schema of Prisma and the database, which we can do regularly
while updating the Prisma schema:

```sh
pnpm db:push
```

Then seed the initial data when needed:

```sh
pnpm db:seed
```

Check if the data is fine:

```sh
pnpm db:check
```

### Build

Check if the build is fine:

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Develop Locally

If everything works fine, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and it should be ready to
go!

The `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) can
also be used when necessary.

## Deployment

This repo has been setup to autodeploy to Vercel automatically on Git push.

> The `@remix-run/vercel` runtime adapter has been deprecated in favor of out of
> the box Vercel functionality and will be removed in Remix v2.  
> No more using the Vercel template & can just use the Remix template instead.
> Will be changed after the upgrade to v2.

After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a
deployment target, [import the Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into
Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If want to avoid using a Git repository, deploy the directory by running
[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
pnpm i -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will
then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its
[Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).
